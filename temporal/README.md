## ðŸ•’ Temporal Alignment

Temporal alignment involves aligning and visualizing plot images taken from **different dates or months** to assess changes over time.

### Tasks:
- Select the first image of each plot from every month.
- Apply homography for each image to warp into a common reference space.
- Overlay warped images to generate a stacked composite.
- Generate per-plot videos that animate progression over time, with each frame showing:
  - Aligned plot image
  - Filename
  - Month label (e.g., `2024-07`)
  - Literal month name (e.g., `July 2024`)
